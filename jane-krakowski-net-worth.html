Jane is a singer and actress, probably best known from being part of the series “30 Rock” as Jenna Maroney. She was also part of the show “Ally McBeal”, and in the Netflix sitcom “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”. All of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Jane Krakowski? As of mid-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $12 million, mostly earned through a successful career as an actress. Aside from television, Jane is also well known for her stage performances. She’s been nominated and has won numerous awards. As she continues her career it is expected that her wealth will increase as well.</p><h3>Jane Krakowski Net Worth $12 million</h3><p>Krakowski’s mother was a theatre instructor, and at a young age Jane was immersed in theatre because of her parents. They took her along with them on their productions and eventually Jane started to take ballet lessons. She soon transitioned to Broadway dancing, and attended the Professional Children’s School. After matriculating, she attended Rutgers University, New Brunswick.</p><p>One of her first major roles on television was in “Search for Tomorrow” in 1984, as the character Theresa Rebecca Kendall. She stayed until the show ended in 1986 and received a few nominations for her performance. Her next big series would come in 1997 when she was cast to play Elaine Vassal in “Ally McBeal”. She stayed there until 2002, and then four years later she became a part of “30 Rock”, staying with the series until the final episode in 2013. In 2015, she was cast in “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”, continuing to rack-up nominations and awards. Aside from her major roles, she also had guest appearances in “The Simpsons”, “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” and “Everwood”.<br>Her major film debut came in 1983’s “National Lampoon’s Vacation”, and she continued making regular film appearances including “Fatal Attraction”, “The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas”, “An American Girl” and “Cirque du Freak”. Despite being busy with her television shows, she still managed to become a part of the films “A Christmas Carol”, “Open Season” and “When Zachary Beaver Came to Town”.</p><p>While she is best known for her television roles, her stage credentials prove to be very extensive as well. She originated the character Dinah the Dining Car in “Starlight Express”, and also appeared in productions of “Grand Hotel”, “Company” and “Once Upon a Mattress”. The musicals also showcased her singing skills, and she even had a hit song entitled “You”, which was released during 2002. She continued making appearances in 2003 with a revival of “Nine”, and two years later she would star in “Guys and Dolls” alongside <a href=#>Ewan McGregor</a>. Krakowski would then be part of a musical adaptation of “Xanadu”. One of her most recent roles was in a production of “She Loves Life” which stars <a href=#>Zachary Levi</a>.</p><p>Overall, Jane’s appearances have reached an impressive number, with almost 30 films, 15 TV productions and almost the same number on satge – her versatility is certainly an attraction for directors and producers.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Jane was in a relationship with documentary maker Marc Singer. She had also previously dated Julian Ovended. In 2009, she was engaged to Robert Godley and they had a son, but they separated after four years.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=30.785019455253><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jane Krakowski</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$12 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 11, 1968</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 4½" (1.64 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Parsippany High School, Rutgers University, Professional Children's School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Robert Godley</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Bennett Robert Godley</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Ed Krajkowski, Barbara Krajkowski</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Robert Godley</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005105/</a></td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Awards</td><td>Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical, Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, Laurence Olivie...</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nominations</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture Made for Television, Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series, Satellite Award for Best Actress – Televi...</td></tr><tr readability=20><td>Movies</td><td>The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, National Lampoon's Vacation, Alfie, Pixels, Pretty Persuasion, Dance with Me, Marci X, Ice Age, Stepping Out, Kit Kittredge: An American Girl, Fatal Attraction, Big Stone Gap, Mrs. Winterbourne, Adult Beginners, When Zachary Beaver Came to Town, Cirque du Freak: T...</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>TV Shows</td><td>30 Rock, Ally McBeal, Another World, ABC Weekend Special, Alex Haley's Queen, Search for Tomorrow, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Ally, Christmas In Rockefeller Center</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=14.24449339207><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=7><td>1</td><td>[on havIng a baby] I learned so much, except how painful labor really is.

However, it is not silent in the Polish language from which the name Krajkowski originates.
