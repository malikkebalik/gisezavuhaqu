Yennefer of Vengerberg from The Witcher showed up at the premiere of the new season, looking extremely fit and slim, which has led fans to wonder what her diet and exercise regime is. Some fans wonder if Anya Chalotra had weight loss while filming for Season 3 of The Witcher.</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Anya Chalotra</strong></a> rose to mainstream prominence in 2019 after the release of the Netflix original series The Witcher in which she played the role of Yennefer of Vengerberg. Now that the third season of the fantasy hit is releasing, the <a href=#><strong>actress</strong></a> has come under the spotlight once again. She's been making public appearances for promotional events and she recently attended the UK premiere of the show. Her fans noticed that she has had a weight loss since the last season and they are discussing that intensely on social media.</p><p>She appears to have gotten noticeably slimmer and fitter than she was before, which has left people wondering what her diet and exercise regime is. Let's talk about Anya Chalotra's weight loss!</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>weight loss</strong></a> stories of <a href=#><strong>Gervonta Davis</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Rochelle Humes</strong></a>.</p><h2>Anya Chalotra's Weight Loss: What Diet and Exercise Routine Does She Follow?</h2><p><strong>Anya Chalotra</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@anyachalotra</a>) appears to have undergone a slight weight loss and now, fans are curious to find out what diet plan and exercise routine she followed that transformed her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/06/anya-chalotra-pic1.jpg alt="Anya Chalotra seems to have had weight loss since the last season of The Witcher. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Anya Chalotra seems to have had weight loss since the last season of The Witcher.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Vogue India</strong></p><p>So, the third installment of The Witcher has released and <strong>Henry Cavill</strong> might have left the show but you will see Anya Chalotra <a href=# rel=noopener>continuing to play</a> sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg in the upcoming season. You saw her at the UK premiere of the latest season, right? You must have and not just that, I bet that you couldn't take your eyes off of her when you saw her because she looked so gorgeous. She looked fantastic in every way.</p><p>And much slimmer than before. The bold black plunging gown that the actress donned in the star-studded event for the premiere of the Netflix fantasy hit made her stand out. She looked striking and had everyone's attention as soon as she reached there. And how she put her abs on display in that dress? She looked extremely slim and people couldn't help but wonder what fitness routine she follows that led to her weight loss.</p><p>The dress Anya Chalotra wore featured a dramatic matching train, giving her a fantasy look but what caught the audience's eyes was how that dress perfectly accentuated and highlighted her impressive abs. How modelesque body she had gotten? She didn't look like that before. She surely had a weight loss since the latest season. She didn't look as skinny back then.</p><p>Not that the Wanderlust star was ever fat or overweight to begin with. She was of normal weight in the first season of The Witcher, if not thin. Not model thin like she is now but skinny regardless. She didn't seem like she needed to lose weight because she didn't look like she had extra pounds on her. But as it turns out, no matter how thin you are, you can always have weight loss because she did.</p><p>Anya Chalotra has gotten noticeably slimmer than before though that does not really constitute a significant weight loss. Fans just want to know what her diet and workout regime is. She has not talked about it much though she did once reveal that she eats a <a href=# rel=noopener>plant-based diet</a>. She has not ever talked about her workout routine or if she has one.</p><h2>Did Anya Chalotra Have a Weight Loss While Filming Season 3 of The Witcher?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/06/anya-chalotra-pic2.jpg alt="Anya Chalotra might have lost weight while filming for Season 3 of The Witcher. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Anya Chalotra might have lost weight while filming for Season 3 of The Witcher.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Variety</strong></p><p>Even if <strong>Anya Chalotra</strong> does not have any workout routine she follows, her job filming for The Witcher is physically exerting which may have resulted in the transformation of her physique and her much-talked-about weight loss. The Netflix fantasy hit is an action-heavy series and it can get <a href=# rel=noopener>physically taxing on the actors</a>. For instance, there was a scene where Chalotra's character had to trudge through waves to reach safety on a beach while toting a baby she was protecting. That actress said that getting out of the sea for that scene was the hardest thing she had ever done.</p><p>Like mentioned above, very very physically demanding which takes a toll on the body. Assuming that season 3 of The Witcher has stunts like that, it's possible that Anya Chalotra might have undergone weight loss while filming for the show. It might sound difficult but as long as she loves to do those things, it should be fine because it can be a physical exercise. And it seems like she loves them. This is what she had to say about filming battle scenes in the first season.</p><p><strong>I loved it, absolutely loved it.
