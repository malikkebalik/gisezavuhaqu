id=content-paragraph-2><strong>Lindsay Hubbard</strong>, 31, went through what many women do when go through break-ups — she lost her appetite and she threw herself into her work, and as a result, she lost a ton of weight. The&nbsp;Summer House&nbsp;star bounced back strong from her stress and anxiety, but something that&nbsp;didn’t, were her boobs, which shrunk with her weight loss. Now, happier than ever and on the heels of the&nbsp;Summer House&nbsp;reunion on Bravo, Lindsay opened up decision to undergo breast augmentation surgery. In an Instagram post on March 16, Lindsay told her friends and fans that she “wanted physical consistency as a woman” and it was “simply time” to pull the trigger and get breast implants. “It’s not something that you randomly are like, “Why don’t I just do this?!” It actually never came into my head until Everett and I broke up last spring,” Lindsay told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> in an EXCLUSIVE interview. “I just didn’t feel as feminine as I wanted to feel.&nbsp;I’m in my 30s, I want to feel like I’m in my 30s as a woman, and part of that is having the physical characteristics, such as boobs!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>After making the decision, Lindsay worked with DC-based doctor, <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Ayman R. Hakki</strong> of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Luxxery Medical Boutique,</a> to find her “perfect fit.” “This is not just about having big ‘fake tits,’ it’s not about a shallow or surface level decision. This is a deeper decision for me, as a woman,” Lindsay explained. “I didn’t do it for a boyfriend. I didn’t do it for anybody except for myself, and when I was ready to do that. I didn’t even go for a size D! I just went for something that fits my body and is consistent.” The response to Lindsay’s Instagram post was greater than she could imagine, and became an open forum for women who want to change something about their body, but are nervous or feel the topic is too “taboo” to discuss. “I got so many DMs, comments, support, and love, which I love starting a conversation with women, because it is a conversation to be had!” she said. “I don’t care what every one else thinks, because every one is going to have an opinion, but I don’t care. I love them and it’s my body, and I’m going to do whatever I want with my body.” We, for one, were obsessed with Lindsay’s transparency and empowering words!</p><a href=# rel=nofollow readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Meet Dr. Hakki!! The sweetest, most talented, and caring doctor around. I want to thank him and the incredible staff at @luxxeryboutique for taking such great care of me throughout this entire process! 🙏🏼 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I am so thankful for being able to experience this journey from the start to now- and I am so excited that I’m able to share it with you all, because it’s a journey that I don’t feel any shame about. It’s an issue that many women face, and it’s a decision that I made for me and me alone- well because I’m an independent woman and I can! 💪🏼 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ It started a year ago when my boyfriend and I broke up. I lost weight as I became increasingly stressed and lost my appetite as one does when they experience that level of heartache. As with most women, my boobs were the first to go with the weight loss. Even as I gained my appetite back and found happiness again, my boobs weren’t growing back- even well into the summer (as you guys can see for yourselves every Monday night). At this point, I decided, as a 31 year old woman, it was time to do something about it. 👊🏼 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I wanted physical consistency as a woman. I wanted to maintain some level of femininity that was more in line with being a woman in my 30’s rather than resembling a teenage girl’s boobs before puberty. I’ve been getting a lot of DM’s and comments from people saying I was fine the way I was before, and I can’t thank everyone enough for loving every part of me 🖤 but this decision was mine to make for myself, and I thought about it for an entire year before I pulled the trigger. It was not impulsive, it was just simply.. time! 🙌🏼 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ This is a good stopping point. Please tune in to our #SummerHouse reunion show with @bravoandy on @bravotv Tuesday, April 3rd to see my new ladies in the flesh and hear more then! 💃🏼 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Thank you all again for taking this journey with me- it means so much to have everyone’s love and support! 😘</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lindsay Hubbard</a> (@lindshubbs) on Mar 16, 2018 at 7:20am PDT</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>You can tune in tonight on Bravo at 10 PM for the&nbsp;Summer House&nbsp;reunion&nbsp;tonight to see Lindsay, her new tee-tahs!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH11e49sZqWhnpnAosWMoaybmpGnsW6u0Z6YrKxdnrqxuMCnq6xlo6q6rrHRZp%2BoraOaeqq6056pr6GVrHw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-heartbeats-by-daniela-andrade.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Meaning Behind The Song: Heartbeats by Daniela Andrade</a>
