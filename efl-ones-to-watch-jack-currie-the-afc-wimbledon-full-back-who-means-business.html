Before the season opener of Sheffield Wednesday against <a class=ath_autolink data-id=682 href=#>Southampton</a> on August 4, we will continue to feature players from all divisions of the EFL.</i></p><p><span>Wimbledon’s academy has always had an eye for talent. It appears to have produced another gem in left-back Jack Currie.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Players such as Al-Wakrah’s </span><span>Ayoub Assal and Huddersfield Town’s Jack Rudoni have come through the ranks in south-west London in recent years before being sold on, with Currie looking set to follow in their footsteps.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Having been relegated to League Two in 2021-22, Wimbledon only just avoided the drop for a second consecutive time last season after finishing 21st, five points above the relegation zone. Currie, however, was their shining light and won four different awards at the end of the season.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><span>There were not many better ways for Currie to get his name recognised other than to score his first goal for Wimbledon in their opening league game of the season against Gillingham. July 30, 2022, at Plough Lane will forever be remembered by the 21-year-old.</span></p><p><span>The goal itself was an example of his great aerial ability, despite being only 5ft 9in (175cm). Following a throw-in from the right by Chris Gunter, Will Nightingale launched a&nbsp; cross into the penalty area that looked to favour oppositional defender Cheye Alexander. But Currie, with a darting run at the far post, thumped a header past goalkeeper Glenn Norris to seal a first victory for manager Johnnie Jackson. Currie won 103 of his 183 aerial duels last season.</span></p><p>Currie’s impressive form continued throughout the season. Even in a side that had to do a lot of defending, his off-the-ball intensity stood out. Looking at the barcode chart below, he ranks highly in defensive metrics regarding his off-the-ball intensity and the success rate of his proactive defending.</p><p><strong><img width=2700 height=2700 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/07/20043703/jack_currie_defending.png alt sizes="(max-width: 2700px) 100vw, 2700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></strong></p><p>Averaging 8.6 ‘true’ tackles per 1,000 opposition touches, Currie attempts to win the ball often. ‘True’ tackles combine successful tackles, fouls committed while attempting a tackle, and failed challenges to reflect how often a player looks to stick a foot in — only two League Two full-backs, Stevenage’s Max Clark and Wimbledon team-mate <a class=ath_autolink data-id=3020nZhvMsMyMFKJ href=#>Huseyin Biler</a>, were more aggressive last campaign.</p><p>Currie leads the way for ‘true’ interceptions, a cumulation of interceptions and blocked passes — showing that he often looks to nip ahead and win the ball as often as he can.</p><p>For a player who attempts so many challenges, his win rate of 75.5 per cent is impressive, showing he is a solid, tough-tackling full-back who defends his flank well.</p><p>On the ball, Currie was not the most expansive last season, averaging 2.9 progressive passes per game, the sixth-lowest rate of any League Two full-back. At his age, however, and in a team who struggled, there is plenty of time to polish this side of his game.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><span>Currie ended the season making 41 league appearances, with a goal and an assist, but ranked second in League Two for the amount of tackles won (85) and most interceptions (75). He played </span><span>3,128 minutes, the third-highest amount for a full-back.</span></p><p><span>Currie is a local lad, too, having grown up in Kingston upon Thames, and is studying a business degree at St Mary’s University in Twickenham.</span></p><p><span>His intelligence off-the-field is parallel to how he performs in-game, but his work ethic has helped raise his performances to another level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After signing his first professional contract aged 18 in 2020 and making his debut in February 2021 during a 3-1 EFL Trophy defeat to Oxford United, h</span><span>e was shipped to National League South club Maidstone United on loan two weeks later. But this was eventually curtailed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</span></p><p><span>Currie was left in limbo upon his return to SW19, but Eastbourne Borough of the National League South came calling for the 2021-22 season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One man was key to bringing Currie to the Sussex club. Then-manager Danny Bloor had a close relationship with former Wimbledon manager Mark Robinson. This was the flint that helped light the spark for Currie’s career.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Robinson said: ‘Look, Danny, we’ve got a player we really like — Jack Currie,’” Bloor says. “He’s a left-back. He needs toughening up, he needs to go and play some men’s football and we know you’ve had a very good record with loan players.</span></p><p><span>“He came down, we met him and from day one he bought into the club. For non-League players to be successful, they need to not just buy into it on the pitch, but off it, too. He really did that.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Currie’s impact at Eastbourne was spectacular, having helped guide them to a sixth-place play-off finish. He made 33 appearances and registered three assists, picking up the players’ player of the year award. And </span><span>Currie’s character off the field was equally as impressive as his performances on it.&nbsp;</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/07/20055103/GettyImages-1423470750-scaled-e1689846706297.jpg alt="Jack Currie AFC Wimbledon" width=1800 height=1272 sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Jack Currie impressed during a disappointing 2022-23 season for AFC Wimbledon (Photo: Pete Norton/Getty Images)</span><p><span>“He doesn’t drink alcohol,” Bloor says. “When we had our Christmas party, he went along and it didn’t worry him one bit, not drinking.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“He’s probably one of the nicest human beings that’s ever played for me. The other players, even the experienced ones, took to him really quickly.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><span>“I speak to Jack on a regular basis. He’s already said he can’t wait to come and watch us at our new team, Welling United (the team Bloor now manages).</span></p><p><span>“When I look back at my time at Eastbourne, I will always remember him as one of the standout players. T</span><span>he sky’s the limit for him. It would never surprise me if he was playing in the Premier League and what goes with playing in the top flight.”</span></p><p><span>Bloor wanted Currie to return for a second spell at Eastbourne, but he had shown enough progress to make a name for himself at his parent club, fending off competition from Paul Osew and Lee Brown to become Wimbledon’s first-choice left-back.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Other clubs have been quick to take note. </span><span>Championship side Bristol City came calling for him in the January transfer window and had several bids rejected.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Based on the scouts watching us in recent weeks, it was probable we would get an offer,” Wimbledon chairman Mick Buckley said in February.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Jack has conducted himself in an exemplary fashion throughout. He’s naturally ambitious and playing in the Championship would obviously be attractive for him but, as someone studying for a business degree, he is smart enough to know that a deal needs to work for all parties.</span></p><p><span>“He didn’t agitate for a move and made it clear that if things didn’t work, we had his 100 per cent commitment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“He is a fantastic role model and will continue to develop here — further opportunities will follow.”</span></p><p>(Top photo: Steven Paston/PA Images via Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3Bnbm9nZXxzfJFsZmlvX2eFcLHFpWSoppWoerW7jLCYrZuYYreir8pmmq6qop6ybq3FnGSwoZ2Xuaawzqdm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-to-subscribe-to-etc-service-or-mtc-card-on-express-way.html>&#171;&nbsp;How To Subscribe To ETC Service Or MTC Card on Express Way</a>
