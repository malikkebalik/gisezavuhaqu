Simpson is a $3 million net-worth American football player, sports commentator, and actor. He is also a convicted criminal as a result of a robbery/kidnapping in Las Vegas in 2007. Simpson was also found financially liable for Ronald Goldman’s murder. Simpson was found not guilty of murdering Ron Goldman and his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson in 1995. He was not civilly sued for Nicole’s death.</p><p>OJ was ordered to pay the Goldman family $33.5 million in damages as a result of the Ron Goldman civil case. With interest, that figure has risen to more than $40 million today. Through the sale of various assets and memorabilia, approximately $500,000 was paid down.</p><p>Today, one of O.J.’s primary sources of income is a fully-funded NFL pension worth up to $5 million. This pension money is protected from being claimed by the Goldman family under state law.</p><h2>Oj Simpson’s Early Life</h2><p>On July 9, 1947, O.J. Simpson was born in San Francisco, California. Eunice, a hospital administrator, and Jimmy Lee Simpson, a chef, and bank custodian raised him there.</p><p>O.J’s father was a well-known drag queen in the San Francisco Bay area who later revealed he was gay and died of AIDS in 1986. O.J. was raised by his mother after his parents divorced in 1952.</p><p>In his early adolescence, O.J. joined the street gang The Persian Warriors and spent time in a juvenile detention center. Simpson was inspired to clean up his life and stay out of trouble after a chance meeting with baseball star Willie Mays.</p><p>He attended community college after graduating from Galileo High School before transferring to the University of Southern California on a football scholarship. He was a Heisman Trophy candidate as a junior at USC and won the award as a senior.</p><h2>Oj Simpson Career</h2><p>Simpson’s professional football career began in 1969 when he signed with the ‘Buffalo Bills.’ He was named ‘Man of the Year by Sport magazine. O.J. Simpson rushed for 1,000 yards five years in a row, from 1972 to 1976.</p><p>He had a successful film career while still playing professional football. Among his 1970s films are ‘The Towering Inferno,’ ‘The Klansman,’ and ‘Capricorn One.’</p><p>On June 12, 1994, he was charged with the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. In 1995, he was exonerated of the charges after a lengthy criminal trial known as ‘People v. Simpson.’</p><p>Later that year, in 1997, a civil court found him liable and ordered him to pay $33.5 million in compensatory and punitive damages.</p><p>On December 4, 2001, the FBI raided his Miami home, suspecting him of drug possession and money laundering. Despite the fact that no illegal drugs were discovered, the investigators discovered equipment that could be used to steal satellite television programming and were sued in federal court for it.</p><p>He was arrested in Las Vegas in September 2007 on several charges, including kidnapping, criminal conspiracy, assault, and armed robbery, and was sentenced to 33 years in prison on December 5, 2008.</p><p>The sentence includes a non-parole period of at least nine years. He is currently incarcerated at the ‘Lovelock Correctional Center.’</p><h3 id=nfl-career>NFL Career</h3><p>Buffalo Bills drafted Simpson first in 1969. Simpson demanded the largest pro sports contract ever: $650,000 for five years. This caused tension with Bill’s owner Ralph Wilson. Simpson threatened to become an actor. Wilson accepted Simpson’s terms. He averaged 622 yards in his first three years.</p><p>Simpson finally rushed 1,000 yards in 1972. In 1973, he was the first NFL player to rush for 2,000 yards. In 1975, he ran for 1,817 yards and 16 touchdowns to win again. The injury ended Simpson’s 1977 season.</p><p>Before the 1978 season, Simpson was traded to the 49ers. His final game was against the Atlanta Falcons on December 16, 1979. O.J. rushed 10 yards for a first down on 3rd-and-10. The Pro Football Hall of Famer played in six Pro Bowls. Simpson made the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team in 2019.</p><h3 id=nfl-career>NFL Earnings</h3><p>OJ demanded (and eventually received after a brief standoff) a 5-year, $650,000 contract when he was selected by the Bills. That is equivalent to roughly $4.5 million in today’s dollars after inflation. It was the largest contract in the annals of professional sports at the time.</p><h3>Entertainment Career</h3><p>Simpson was also a successful actor, producer of television, and spokesperson for commercials. He was already acting in TV shows and movies before he left the NFL. He acted in movies like The Klansman and The Naked Gun series, and the miniseries Roots, and in the early 1980s, he produced a number of TV movies.</p><p>OJ began serving as the spokesperson for Hertz car rentals in the 1970s. In 1984, James Cameron considered having Simpson play the title role in The Terminator; however, Cameron ultimately chose Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Simpson was not a part of the production.</p><p>Simpson worked as a commentator for Monday Night Football, which was broadcast on ABC at the time, in addition to his acting career.</p><h2>Oj Simpson’s Personal Life</h2><p>Simpson married Marguerite Whitley when he was 19 years old. They had three children together: Arnelle, Jason, and Aaren Simpson. Aaren tragically drowned in the family’s swimming pool in August 1979.</p><p>In 1977, Simpson met Nicole Brown, a nightclub waitress. Simpson was still married to his first wife, but the two began dating. Simpson and Whitley divorced in March 1979. O.J. married Nicole in February 1985, and they had two children, Sydney and Justin.</p><p>Their marriage lasted seven years. Simpson pleaded no contest to spousal abuse in 1989. Their divorce was finalized in 1992. They made an unsuccessful attempt at reconciliation in 1993.</p><h2>Oj Simpson Pension Money</h2><p>OJ was eligible for a pension from the NFL once he turned 55. It’s widely assumed that OJ delayed taking his pension payments until he was 65 in order to receive a larger monthly payment ($10,565 instead of $4,034). If this is correct, the NFL began paying him $10,565 per month in 2012.</p><p>Because he couldn’t access or use the money while incarcerated, approximately $602,000 would have accumulated in OJ’s bank account. According to one of his close friends, OJ also has a fully funded personal pension worth anywhere between $2 and $5 million, depending on how the assets were invested and performed.</p><p>He is also said to have a Screen Actors Guild pension worth around $1700 per month. Fortunately for OJ, pension income cannot be affected by bankruptcy or legal judgment, making it completely inaccessible to the Goldman family.</p><p><span data-amp-original-style="font-size: 12pt;" class=amp-wp-57c6437><strong>Read More:</strong></span></p><ul><li><a href=#>Canadian Basketball Player Andrew Wiggins Net Worth 2022, How Much Money Does Dandrew Wiggins Make?</a></li><li><a href=#>Bryce Young Net Worth 2022: Biography, Income, Career, Cars and Assets</a></li><li><a href=#>Nick Saban Net Worth 2022: Early Life, Career, Personal Life, Age, Height And More</a></li><li><a href=#>Carson Wentz Net Worth 2022: Early Life, Career, Personal Life, Salary, And Endorsement!</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX6S3br%2FIpqesp55kjKK5z3Zo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kelis-bio-wiki.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kelis Bio (Wiki)</a>
