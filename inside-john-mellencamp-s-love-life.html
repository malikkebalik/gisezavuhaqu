Known for his strings of heartland rock hits, Mellencamp is lauded worldwide for his unflinchingly honest tracks. Some of John's timeless hits are <i>Hurts So Good, Pink Houses, Small Town, Paper in Fire, Cherry Bomb</i>, and <i>Crumblin Down</i>. &nbsp;</p><p>The Grammy winner long performed under the stage name Johny Cougar before but only rose to stardom after dropping the moniker. The Seymour, Indiana-born singer's career dates back to the 80s, when he took over the charts as one of the fastest-rising rock artists. &nbsp;</p><h3>The Complete Truth About John Mellencamp's Personal Life! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>Aside from his stellar career, Mellencamp's personal life has drawn as much attention over the years. The Hall of Fame inductee's foremost relationship was with<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Priscilla Esterline</strong></a><strong>,</strong> who he went on to marry in 1970. The pair's marriage lasted over a decade, during which they welcomed one daughter, <strong>Michelle.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/15/342511286_183023978006705_504844381628678872_n%20(1)%20(1)-1686851379942.jpg><p>Mellencamp's first marriage experience flew under the radar. The couple, who share an age gap of 19 years, reportedly finalized their divorce in 1981, the same year, John delved into his second marriage with <strong>Victoria Granucci.</strong> The insinuating timeline soon unveiled the fact that the singer had been unfaithful to his first wife. &nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Small Town </i>crooner reportedly crossed paths with Granucci in 1979. The latter was allegedly a college student and also working part-time, playing extras in music videos when Mellencamp fell head over heels for her. The couple welcomed two daughters, <strong>Teddi</strong>, and <strong>Justice</strong>, during their eight-year-long nuptial. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/15/340025690_641196461168565_1474987761048937270_n%20(1)%20(1)-1686851387733.jpg><p>By the time Granucci became the second wife to the Grammy-winning singer, he was already a father and grandfather of one. Several sources allege that the former student dedicated her life to being a doting mom, stepmom, and step-grandma to Melllencamp's brood. &nbsp;</p><p>Reports of the duo's rocky marriage started surfacing around the 90s, with rumors of Mellencamp's infidelity while on tours being the main cause. Citing "irreconcilable differences" as the reason John and his second ended their marriage in 1991. &nbsp;</p><p>Although not much is known about the aftermath of their separation, the pair reportedly decided on a cordial relationship for the sake of their kids. Further Proving his romantic inclination, singer Mellencamp married his third wife, American model <strong>Elaine Irwin,</strong> less than a year after his second divorce. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/15/335890209_1160732341260167_5090683920909694758_n%20(1)%20(1)-1686851396622.jpg><p>The <i>Cherry Bomb</i> hitmaker and Irwin tied the knot in 1992 and called it quits in 2010. The rockstar once recalled how Elaine kept his wandering behaviors in check by getting girls and hangers-on booted from his backstage. The rocker shares two sons, <strong>Hud</strong>, and <a href=#>Speck,</a><strong> </strong>with his third ex-wife. &nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Jack & Diane</i> crooner had the most high-profile relationship with actress <strong>Meg Ryan</strong>, who he dated on and off for nearly a decade. The duo's relationship never made it to the alter but at their peak, they were as famous and considered as powerful as any other A-list couple. &nbsp;</p><p>Like all of his previous relationships, John's rapport with Ryan also came at the heels of his third unveiling marriage; a mere coincidence or a pattern revelation? The love birds kept their romance low-key in the beginning before going all in. The duo split ways multiple times but came back together every time. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/15/328578703_1144272312777733_5463588915887258927_n%20(1)%20(1)-1686851418936.jpg><p>The singer and actor couple even got engaged at one point. Sources revealed that the Indiana-born singer got exhausted from the never-ending highs-lows of their relationship, and <a href=#>decided to end it</a> for good in 2019. In his latest interview, John admits to being a bad boyfriend to Ryan. "I love Meg Ryan, She doesn't love me so much," <a href=#>the singer said</a>. &nbsp;</p><h3>John Mellencamp Relationship Status? &nbsp;</h3><p>Following his infamous split from Ryan. the<i> Pink Houses </i>hitmaker has dated a parade of pretty faces. Mellencamp was linked with supermodel <strong>Christie Brinkley</strong> during one of his breaks from Ryan. After he broke off his engagement with the actress, John briefly dated nurse <strong>Jamie Sherrill</strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/15/317195634_1371088236967386_8275574659789623878_n%20(1)%20(1)-1686851413071.jpg><p>Mellencamp moved on with<strong> Natasha Barrett</strong> after quietly breaking up with Jamie in 2021. The romance reportedly fizzled out within months. The relatively latent rockstar continued his search for the one by dating<strong> Marianelly Agosto</strong>, a skincare expert, in 2022. The pair met through Mellencamp's daughter, <a href=#>Teddi</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Small Town </i>hitmaker is still believed to be dating Agosto, who is 27 years younger than him. Mellencamp hasn't been so forthcoming about his ongoing romance with the young beauty, but an insider says the twosome have been on-and-off all this time. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mellencamp describes his ideal woman!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>It seems that Mellencamp is still yet to decide if Agosto is in his life for a season or for a lifetime, but the Grammy winner previously dished on his preference. "I donât care how much money the person's got. Is she a nice person? Is she funny? Can she stand John Mellencamp?"<a href=#> John had said</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to<a href=#> Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqKlrKGUmnqru8enZKadnKGyr6%2FApqesZZykw6Z5y6Kdng%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./rhony-dorinda-s-drinking-causes-concern-leah-s-behavior-sends-ramona-over-the-edge.html>&#171;&nbsp;RHONY: Dorindas Drinking Causes Concern &amp;amp; Leahs Behavior Sends Ramona Over The Edge</a>
