What happened to their relationship? How did they move on with their lives? Here is a summary of their love story, from their first encounter to their final separation.</p><p><strong>How They Met</strong></p><p>Marta Fitzgerald was a former aerobics instructor and a journalism graduate from the University of North Florida. She was also a fan of Rush Limbaugh.&nbsp;In 1990, she sent him an email through CompuServe, an online service provider, expressing her admiration for his work. Rush was intrigued by her message and replied to her.&nbsp;They started an online correspondence that soon turned into a phone romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rush-Limbaugh-and-wife-Martha-Fitzgerald.jpg><p>At that time, Marta was still married to her first husband, Tom, with whom she had two children.&nbsp;Rush Limbaugh also divorced his second wife, Michelle Sixta, a college usherette, in 1990 after seven years of marriage. They had no children together.</p><p><strong>How They Got Married</strong></p><p>Marta and Rush dated for four years, keeping their relationship mostly private and away from the media spotlight. They finally decided to tie the knot on May 27, 1994, in a lavish and secretive ceremony.&nbsp;They got married at the United States Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence Thomas officiating the wedding.&nbsp;The wedding was attended by only a few close friends and family members and was kept a secret from the public until the next day.</p><p>Marta Fitzgerald and Rush Limbaugh’s residence was in Palm Beach, Florida.&nbsp;They bought a property on North Ocean Boulevard in 1998 for $3.9 million.&nbsp;The property consisted of three homes, with a total of 24,000 square feet of living space, and had beach access.&nbsp;They also had a radio studio in Palm Beach, where Limbaugh broadcasted his show.</p><p><strong>How They Divorced</strong></p><p>Marta and Rush seemed to have a happy and successful marriage. They lived a luxurious lifestyle, traveling around the world, attending social events, and hosting parties for their friends and guests. But behind the scenes, they were facing some challenges and difficulties.

Marta was supportive of her husband’s recovery. However, they decided to end their marriage in 2004, after 10 years of being together. The cause of the divorce is not clearly stated. However, some sources suggest that they had frequent arguments and grew apart over time.&nbsp;They announced their divorce in a joint statement, saying that they had “mutually and amicably” agreed to part ways.

Rush, on the other hand, continued his career as a radio host, television personality, and political commentator.

They had a lavish wedding at the Breakers Resort in Palm Beach, with guests such as Sean Hannity, Karl Rove, and Tom Watson. They lived in Rush’s mansion in Florida and traveled around the world.
