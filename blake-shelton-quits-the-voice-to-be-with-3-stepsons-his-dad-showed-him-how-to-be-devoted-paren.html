A source revealed that the three boys were excited that their mother was marrying Shelton and were eager to be a part of the wedding.</p><p class=Xg>Stefani welcomed her sons, Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo, with her ex-husband, Gavin Rossdale. When talking about how it felt to have stepchildren, Shelton <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/country/blake-shelton-talks-family-life-with-gwen-stefani/>said</a>:</p><p class=Xg>"I've married into a family."</p><p class=Xg>Shelton admitted that Stefani was skeptical about whether or not he could be a stepdad to her children and whether their relationship would last because she had children from a previous marriage, but Shelton proved her fears invalid.</p><p class=Xg>The country star has mentioned on many occasions that he is enamored with his stepsons and loves to teach them new skills like fishing and starting fires on his ranch.
