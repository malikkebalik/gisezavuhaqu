He had trouble speaking and he looked very thin. I don’t know if he has health issues or not but I think General Hospital has pretty much decided not to bring the character of Luke back because Anthony Gary is enjoying retirement.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>His husband (Claudio Gama) posts pics and videos of Tony on Instagram every once in awhile but he’s never spoken in the videos and I’ve often wondered if he’s not doing well. Hopefully it’s just that he prefers to not speak on social media.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I didn’t know Tony Geary has a husband…i didn’t know he was Gay. This is new to me. I hope he is well, I know he is well into his 70’s so maybe it’s just old age.</p><p>There were rumors going around for years. I absolutely love and miss Tony Geary and wondered if he might come back for the 60th anniversary and most recently for Bobbie’s death so I did a search awhile back and saw posts that he was married to Claudio Gama so I checked out Claudio’s Instagram page and sure enough he refers to Tony as his husband. Claudio is also followed on Instagram by Finola Hughes and Kin Shriner and other actors from GH.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I saw a video maybe a year and a half ago were someone was following Tony around where he lived in the Netherlands (Holland) and kept asking him to agree to come back to GH. He spoke in that video and did not have any trouble. He walked with a cane and it appeared that he was depending on it for support. The person asked him if they doubled the amount he received while he was working would he come back. He replied something like the salary I got was a joke and doubling is a joke. He also said to leave me alone. I don’t remember where I saw it.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I had heard that years and years ago because my daughter has an a friend who’s an attorney to certain celebrities but it was a big secret, he did not want it to be let out. That’s why I was surprised to see it here and that anyone else knew but I guess in 2023 nobody cares anymore thank goodness or at least most people don’t. At least he can be himself.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/c/e495f1/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> CCAP82016:<p>I didn’t know Tony Geary has a husband…i didn’t know he was Gay.
