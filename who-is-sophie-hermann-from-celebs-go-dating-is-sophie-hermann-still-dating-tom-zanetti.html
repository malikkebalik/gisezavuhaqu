It seemed like a mini-vacation, which was nice.’</p><p>Tom had a brief appearance early in the series and blended in well with the rest of the cast. Despite the fact that Sophie admitted to giving him a “small makeover.” ‘He’s not allowed to wear jeans that are three times too tight any longer because they cut off his blood circulation,’ Sophie said of Tom’s changes after moving in with the Chelsea cast. ‘I don’t want to make him change, but I despise his tight jeans.’</p><p>It comes after weeks of rumors that they started dating while filming the show in a £30 million estate in Surrey (which is still on the market, btw).</p><p>Tom Read Wilson of Celebs Go Dating has also stated that he assisted Tom in winning Sophie’s heart by urging him to write her a poem. ‘With that particular union, I feel a lot more responsibility.’</p><p>He told Entertainment Daily, “You know, I was always such a supporter of it.” ‘I figured as long as Sophie sees Tom’s incredibly artistic sophisticated side, she’ll completely fall in love with him.’ ‘And she succeeded.’</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Who Is Alyssa Mckay Dating In 2022?
