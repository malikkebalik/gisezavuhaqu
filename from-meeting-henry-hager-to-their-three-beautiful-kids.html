But despite her many designations, Hager is best known as one-half of 43rd U.S. President<strong> George W. Bush</strong> and former First Lady <strong>Laura Bush</strong>'s fraternal twins. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on November 25, 1981, in Dallas, Texas, in a political household- her familial predecessors include the 41st President <strong>George H. W. Bush, Senator Prescot Bush</strong>, and more in the line. Hager and her sister, <strong>Barbara</strong>,<strong> </strong>have successfully carved their careers outside of the chaotic political spectrum, making them beloved figures to look up to. &nbsp;</p><h2>How did Jenna Bush Hager and her Husband Meet? &nbsp;</h2><p>Jenna Bush Hager, 41, famously hosts <i>Today with Hoda & Jenna,</i> with journalist <strong>Hoda Kotb.</strong> Fans often hear of Jenna's blissful married life and her family's mundane day-to-day lives. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/5/328548740_854292419005156_6989674954972043834_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683301831211.jpg><p>The President's progeny married business executive<strong> Henry Chage Hager </strong>in 2008. Jenna might be living a rather ordinary marital life with her husband of fourteen years. The Hagers attracted little to no scrutiny, but the duo's romance wasn't taken this lightly back in the 2000s.</p><p>Jenna and Henry met at her father's presidential campaign in <i>2004</i>. In an episode of <i>Todaya with Hoda & Jenna</i> earlier this year, the journalist revealed how she manipulated her now-husband to propose to her.</p><p>Jenna <a href=#>recalled</a> how she gave her then-boyfriend an ultimatum to get engaged. But it was only after years into their dating bliss that Henry finally popped the question.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jenna Bush Hager Exchanged Her Vows In An Intimate Wedding!</h2><p>Henry Chage Hager got to his knee during a hiking trip to Maine in 2007.&nbsp;Henry had allegedly asked the former President for his blessing before he proposed to Jenna Bush Hager.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/5/280533866_164052102701741_1633537884197881725_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683301838663.jpg><p>The couple walked down the aisle in a private ceremony at Ex-President Bush's property. Jenna exchanged her wedding vows at <i>Prairie Chapel ranch in Crawford, Texas</i>, on May 10, 2008. Almost fifteen years and three kids later, the pair are still going strong. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The couple tied the knot after years of dating at Jenna's father's Prairie Chapel in Crawford, Texas, in 2008! &nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Jenna's appreciation posts for her loving husband and their kids pop up frequently on her social media platforms. And the blonde beauty keeps fans entertained with funny anecdotes now and then. &nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Sisters First</i> author recently spilled an incident that preceded her wedding day. Jenna shared how her mother, the former First Lady gave her daughters a "cringy" sex talk a day before her big day. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Get to Know Jenna Bush Hager's Husband, Henry Hager! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>Jenna Bush Hager's now-husband, Henry Hager, holds a prestigious background. Hager is the son of late politician <strong>John H. Hager</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Henry has an MBA degree from the University of Virginia. Moreover, Jenna's husband previously worked as the managing director at Waterous Energy Fund. Henry steers clear from the limelight but doesn't mind pleasing his wife by making rare appearances on Jenna's show.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/5/321350625_1804888213228901_433374496167371603_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683301849291.jpg><p>For Jenna's 40th birthday, the business executive appeared as a guest on NBC's Today Show. Moreover, Henry even did a gig as a host on the show's <i>Man with a Mic </i>segment.</p><p>The otherwise low-profile Hager ended the gig by lauding his wife for what she does daily. "That was tough," Hager noted as he went on to hype his wife. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Everything to Know About Jenna Bush Hager's Three Kids! &nbsp;</h3><p>Jenna Bush Hager's biggest dream came true when she became a mother. The news presenter and her husband, Henry Hager, welcomed their firstborn, <strong>Mila Hager</strong>, in April 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/5/321511656_540868714427164_4180998038629973729_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683301858798.jpg><p>The Today host explained how becoming a mother changed her perception of herself and her life.</p><p>"I think having children and your body changing in that way is such a good sort of reset," <a href=#>Jenna said</a>.</p><p>The author/journalist and her business executive husband are doting parents to two more kids. The Hagers welcomed a daughter <strong>Poppy Louise</strong>,<strong> </strong>and a son <strong>Hal</strong>. Jenna and Henry gave birth to them in 2015 and 2019, respectively.</p><p>Jenna's kids are too young to decide on a career. Or even showcase a distinctive penchant, for that matter. But each of them, Mila, Poppy, and Hal, have their personalities.&nbsp;</p><h3>Jenna's Reasoning Behind Her Kids' Name</h3><p>The <i>Ana's Story</i> author, Jenna Bush Hager, named her firstborn after her grandmother. And it is no surprise that Mila is growing up to become the ideal eldest sibling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/5/308471255_1293524361417431_7830526688144298912_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683301868689.jpg><p>While commemorating her daughter's (Mila) birthday, Jenna listed her powerful attributes as "creative, empathetic, generous, and kind. &nbsp;</p><p>"What a gorgeous gift it is to be your mama," Jenna wrote as she celebrated Mila's 10th birthday earlier this year.</p><p>Jenna and her husband Henry named their second daughter, Poppy, again after a family. Poppy is the name of Jenna's grandfather. The Today host loves showing off her daughters' bonding on Instagram, but the two couldn't be more different. &nbsp;</p><p>While Jenna associates her eldest with everything gentle and kind, she determines her second daughter's character as "feisty, firecracker, and fierce."&nbsp;</p><p>The long-married couple's youngest, Hal, arrived just three years ago. Hal's name, like his sisters', also carries a family significance. The<i> Today</i> host said she felt content and happy after the birth of her boy. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqKlrKGUmnqrsc2nmGaapai1brTAoJyrq12drrG82GaaqKaaqrSiuIyloJ%2Bd</p></div><div id=links><a href=./melissa-gisoni-height-weight-age-spouse-family-facts-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Melissa Gisoni Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Family, Facts, Biography</a>
