said it had mysteriously vanished.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Just weeks before the murder, a furious Zito was heard threatening to kill Pandrella, who had by then given a portion of the money&nbsp;back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On October 26, 2018, Pandrella told Zito he was ready to pay up and showed up at his Brooklyn home.&nbsp;But instead of handing over the
