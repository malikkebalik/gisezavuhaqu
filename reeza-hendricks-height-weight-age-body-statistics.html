sport (ODIs and T20Is), as a top-order batter. Before breaking into the senior national team in November 2014, he was an integral member of the South African squad that had reached the final of the 2008 Under-19 ICC Cricket World Cup. In the South African domestic circuit, he has played for Griqualand West (2006-07–2015-16), Knights (2006-07–2015-16), Lions (2016-17–2020-21), and Gauteng (2021-22–Present) across all 3 formats. In the&nbsp;MSL (Mzansi Super League), he turned out for Jozi Stars (2018–2019).</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Reeza Raphael Hendricks</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Reeza</p><figure id=attachment_420260 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-420260 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Reeza Hendricks as seen in an Instagram Post in October 2021 (Reeza Hendricks / Instagram)</figure><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Leo</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Kimberley, Northern Cape Province, South Africa</p><h3>Residence</h3><p>Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p></p><h3>Occupation</h3><p>Professional Cricketer</p><figure id=attachment_420259 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-420259 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Reeza Hendricks as seen in an Instagram Post in May 2022 (Reeza Hendricks / Instagram)</figure><h3>Family</h3><ul><li><strong>Siblings&nbsp;</strong>– Beuran Hendricks (Younger Brother) (Professional Cricketer)</li><li><strong>Others&nbsp;</strong>– Jason van Zyl (Cousin) (Cricketer)</li></ul><h3>Batting</h3><p>Right-Handed</p><h3>Bowling</h3><p>Right-Arm Off-Break/Medium-Fast</p><h3>Role</h3><p>Top-Order Batter</p><h3>Jersey Number</h3><ul><li>17 – One Day International (ODI), Knights (South African Domestic Cricket), Lions (South African Domestic Cricket), Jozi Stars (MSL)</li><li>17, 77 – T20 International (T20I)</li></ul><h3>Build</h3><p>Athletic</p><h3>Height</h3><p>5 ft 9 in or 175 cm</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>73 kg or 161 lbs</p><h3>Girlfriend / Spouse</h3><p>Reeza has dated –</p><li><strong>Lee-Ann Hendricks</strong> (2018-Present) – Reeza married his long-term girlfriend Lee-Ann in September 2018 and they have a son&nbsp;together named Callum (b.

This included the first century of his career in the T20 format – a score of 102 runs not out for Lions, in a match against the Dolphins,&nbsp;in November 2017.</li><li>In January 2018, he scored a century in the final round of the 2017–18 season of the Momentum One Day Cup (the premier domestic one-day cricket competition in South Africa). This made him the first player ever to have scored a century in all 3 formats of the sport in the same season of domestic cricket in South Africa. In addition to the aforementioned centuries in the T20 and the one-day formats, he had produced a knock of 108 runs in a 4-day first-class match in October 2017.</li><li>In August 2018, on his ODI debut, in the 3rd match of a 5-match bilateral away ODI series against Sri Lanka, Reeza scored 102 runs off just 89 balls to help South Africa pile a mammoth total of 363 runs. South Africa went on to win the match by 78 runs and take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series. He was named the ‘Player of the Match’ for his performance.</li><li>This century made him just the 3rd batsman for South Africa (after Colin Ingram and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Temba Bavuma</a>), and the 14th overall, to have scored a century on his ODI debut. It was also the then-fastest century (achieved in 88 balls) by a batsman on his ODI debut.</li><li>In December 2018, he finished as the 3rd-highest run-getter (only behind <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Rassie van der Dussen</a> and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Quinton de Kock</a>) in the inaugural edition of the Mzansi Super League, with 412 runs in 9 innings at a stellar average of 58.85 runs per inning and an impressive strike rate of 142.56 runs scored per 100 balls faced. This performance consisted of 4 consecutive scores of more than 50 runs – including back-to-back centuries. His batting was instrumental in&nbsp;Jozi Stars winning the title.</li><li>In April 2022, in the final of the first division of the 2021–22 season of the CSA One-Day Cup (the premier domestic one-day cricket competition in South Africa), he scored 157 runs to help the Lions chase down a steep target of 319 runs set by the Titans. The Lions won the match by 3 wickets to lift the title.</li><li>In late July 2022, in a 3-match bilateral away T20I series against England, Reeza produced scores of 50 runs or more in all 3 matches (57 runs, 53 runs, and 70 runs, respectively). South Africa went on to win the series by a 2–1 margin, and Reeza (180 runs), as the highest run-scorer on either side across the 3 matches, was named the ‘Player of the Series’.</li><li>In South Africa’s next T20I match, against Ireland in August 2022, he was named the ‘Player Of The Match’ for scoring 74 runs off 53 balls. This meant that he had produced scores of 50 runs or more in 4 successive T20I matches.</li><li>As of September 2022, this was still the world record, jointly held by Reeza, <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Brendon McCullum</a> of New Zealand (achieved between December 2008 and February 2009; in matches against the West Indies, Australia, and India (twice)), <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Chris Gayle</a> of the West Indies (achieved between June 2012 and September 2012; in matches against New Zealand (twice), Australia, and England), Craig Williams of Namibia (achieved between April 2021 and October 2021; in matches against Uganda, the United Arab Emirates, Scotland, and Papua New Guinea), Rayyan Pathan of Canada (achieved between November 2021 and February 2022; in matches against Bermuda, Argentina, Panama, and the Philippines), and Gustav Mckeon of France (achieved in July 2022; in matches against Czech Republic, Switzerland, Norway, and Estonia).</li><li>Gustav, amazingly, had done so within just a week (July 24 – July 30, 2022). Among the aforementioned 6 players, Rayyan (once) and Gustav (twice) were the only ones to have converted any of those four 50+ scores into a hundred. All of these players, with Reeza being the only exception, had produced these four 50+ scores against at least 3 different countries.</li><li>In September 2022, he was acquired by the Johannesburg Super Kings in an auction that was held for the teams involved in the inaugural edition (scheduled to take place between January and February 2023) of the SA20, a franchise-based T20 league to be played in South Africa. SA20 became just the 2nd cricket league in the world, after the IPL (Indian Premier League), to follow an auction model for recruiting players for its franchise teams. The SA20 was the 3rd attempt by Cricket South Africa (the governing body for both professional and amateur cricket in the country) to establish a top-notch franchise-based T20 league.</li><li>CSA’s first such attempt was in 2017 with the T20 Global League which was deferred (from November 2017) by a year due to the lack of a broadcast deal and a title sponsor. In June 2018, the event was replaced by Mzansi Super League, a tournament that was played in 2018 and 2019 with a 6-team round-robin and knockout format. Thereafter, the league was scuppered by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and later by the structural changes that were announced for South African domestic cricket in 2021.</li><li>The SA20 was then founded by Cricket South Africa in 2022 with the assistance of administrators and businesspeople from India – former IPL&nbsp;COO Sundar Raman acquired a 20% stake in the league while all 6 franchise teams in the SA20 were bought by franchise owners from the IPL. Cricket South Africa was so desperate to get this league going that the board canceled an away bilateral ODI series against Australia (scheduled for January 2023 and in direct conflict with the inaugural edition of the SA20), a move that could eventually and potentially cost them a direct qualification spot for the 2023 edition of the ICC (International Cricket Council) Cricket World Cup.</li><p>Featured Image by Reeza Hendricks / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqucnrKRYrWmusOroJyjo2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./shane-harper.html>&#171;&nbsp;Shane Harper</a>
