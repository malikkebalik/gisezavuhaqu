He is perhaps best known for being a musician – singer and songwriter, who performed with <a href=#>James Brown</a> during the 1970s, and was later a member of Parliament-Funkadelic, a funk, soul and rock music band. He is also recognized for being the founder of his own band called Bootsy`s Rubber Band. His career in the world of music has been active since 1969.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Bootsy Collins is, as of mid-2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Collins’ net worth is over $3 million. This sum of money has been accumulated through his successful career on the music scene. He is also the owner of an online school, which has increased his net worth considerably.</p><h3>Bootsy Collins Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>Bootsy Collins` career began as early as 1968 when he founded funk band The Pacemakers, which consisted of his brother Phelps Collins, Philippé Wynne and Frankie “Kash” Waddy. Two years after its inception, the band joined James Brown as his touring and recording band, which only increased Bootsy`s net worth and popularity. However, they only played for James Brown for just a little under a year, and soon disbanded.</p><p>After that, Bootsy formed several bands, often with his friends and brother, most notably House Guests, with which he released two songs, which only added further to his net worth.</p><p>However, his life changed in 1972, when he joined the George Clinton`s funk group Funkadelic, and at the same time, he became the part of Clinton`s second project – Parliament. From that point on, his career and net worth have gone only upwards. He has contributed to more than 10 albums, released by Funkadelic-Parliament, which has added a substantial amount to his net worth.</p><p>In 1976, Bootsy formed Bootsy`s Rubber Band, with which he released 11 albums in total, but needed to change name of the band, as he lost the rights for the name to a folk music band. Some of the albums include “Stretchin’ Out in Bootsy’s Rubber Band” (1976), which was the band`s debut album, “This Boot is Made for Fonk-N” (1979), and “Jungle Bass” (1990), among others, all of which have added to his net worth.</p><p>Bootsy has also been recognized for his solo career, during which he has released seven albums in total, which also represents a large part of his net worth. His debut album came out in 1980, entitled “Ultra Wave”, and during the 1980s he released two more solo albums – “The One Giveth, the Count Taketh Away” (1982), and “What’s BootsyDoin’?” (1988). His next solo release came out in 1997, under the title “Fresh Outta “P” University”, and five years later, came his fifth solo album, “Play with Bootsy” (2002). Bootsy`s latest release is the album “Tha Funk Capital of the World”, released in 2011.</p><p>Most recently, Bootsy has started an online University, “Bootsy Collins’ Funk University”, which teaches its students how to play a bass guitar. Thanks to his skills, Bootsy has received several prestigious awards, and recognitions, including the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1997, among many others.</p><p>Speaking about his personal life, there is little information about Bootsy Collins, except the fact that he is married to Patti Collins, and that he is the uncle of famous rapper <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a>/<a href=#>Snoop Lion</a>. In free time he is active on his official Twitter account, on which he has over 1 million followers.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.898203592814><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Bootsy Collins</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 26, 1951</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Cincinnati, Ohio, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 2½" (1.89 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Soundtrack, Music Department, Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Patti Collins</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Bill Jr.</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Nettie Collins</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Catfish Collins</td></tr><tr readability=0.35555555555556><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/BootsyCollins</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.31818181818182><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/bootsy_collins</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0172182</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Grammy Award for Best Music Video</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Movies</td><td>Standing in the Shadows of Motown, Bootsy's New Rubber Band: Live, Learn to Play Funk Bass: Level 2, Learn to Play Funk Bass: Level 1, Parliament Funkadelic: The Mothership Connection: Live 1976, Moog, Show Stoppers</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=2.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Wild, colorful outfits and star-shaped sunglasses</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Very high-pitched and animated speech style</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=17.632450331126><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=13><td>1</td><td>It wasn't about black, white, green grass, bluegrass, it was all about music to me. All music had a certain effect on me and I appreciated all of it. Music is all one, not to be separated. It doesn't need a name. The key question is, "How does it make you feel?" Funk is where you don't have nothing and you make something out of nothing. I didn't have a bass, so I made my guitar into a bass.

Even though I had all the respect in the world for <a href=#>James Brown</a>, the push for independence and wanting to be free, to express ourselves on stage and dress differently, was too great. We were supposed to be in suits, shoes, well-groomed, and we wanted to do the wild thing. And we knew we couldn't do the wild thing with James Brown. It was his way or the highway. George [<a href=#>George Clinton</a>] was like, "Whatever you can bring to the party, bring it". I would never have rode in the car with James Brown, with three chicks in the back seat, getting high. Anything and everything was possible with George. That was one extreme to the other.
